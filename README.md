# LMS_PHP-and-Bootstrap
This is an individual project that I have done for my Second year second semester. A learning management system with 3 users as Admin, Lecture and Student. I have used PHP for the backend, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap 4 for the Front End and Database is MySQL.
